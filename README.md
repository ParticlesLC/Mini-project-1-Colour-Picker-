All of these projects are unoriginal and i created them with videos, do not assume i have created these.
all original projects will be seperate from this folder, this folder is for learning purposes, putting code into practical use is what helps me learn the best. 
of course mindlessly following videos is not practical.
that is why i decided that i must be able to rewrite all of the code from scratch.
